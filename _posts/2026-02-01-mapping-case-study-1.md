### 🎯 For Developers, Builders & Property Owners

If you own, manage, or are planning work on a property and need **accurate visual documentation** — not just pretty footage — this case study shows exactly how drone mapping fits into real-world projects.

I currently offer:

* Drone mapping & site documentation
* Orthomosaics & property overviews
* Construction progress flights
* Real estate aerial media

## Context: What This Case Study Was

This project was a **hands-on drone mapping test** performed on a real residential property in the Chicago area.

The goal was not marketing.

The goal was to:

* Practice a real mapping workflow
* Capture structured aerial data
* Produce deliverables that mirror what developers, contractors, and inspectors actually need
* Validate timing, effort, and pricing for future paid work

This was designed as **Case Study #1** — the foundation for a series of mapping and construction documentation projects.

---

## The Objective

Instead of cinematic shots, this mission focused on:

* Accuracy over aesthetics
* Repeatability over creativity
* Data capture over storytelling

The primary deliverable was a **clean orthomosaic map** that clearly shows:

* Property boundaries
* Roof geometry
* Lot layout
* Surrounding context

This is the type of output that supports:

* Pre-construction planning
* Site measurements
* Documentation before renovations
* Long-term progress tracking

## The Process: How the Mapping Mission Worked

### 1. Mission Planning

Before flying, I created a structured flight plan designed for mapping, not video.

Key parameters included:

* Grid-based flight pattern
* Consistent altitude
* High overlap for accurate stitching
* Slow, controlled speed

I also checked:

* Airspace clearance
* Wind conditions
* Lighting consistency
* Battery requirements

Planning time: ~15 minutes.

This step is critical — mapping quality is decided **before** the drone ever leaves the ground.

---

### 2. Gear & Software Setup

![GIF PLACEHOLDER #2 — Controller + tablet setup](/img/mapping-controller.gif)

For this mission, I used:

* DJI drone capable of mapping workflows
* Automated flight software
* Standard camera settings optimized for consistency
* iPhone/Insta360 for behind-the-scenes capture

No specialized surveying hardware.

No enterprise-only gear.

This is important because it proves that **entry-level mapping is accessible**, while still delivering real value.

---

### 3. Flying the Mission

Once launched, the flight was fully structured and predictable.

* Automated grid execution
* Consistent altitude across the site
* Overlapping passes for clean stitching
* No manual cinematic moves

Total flight time: ~12–15 minutes  
Batteries used: 1

The key difference from real estate video work is discipline — letting the mission run without creative interference.

---

### 4. Processing & Output

![GIF PLACEHOLDER #3 — Map processing / orthomosaic preview](/img/orthomosaic-preview.gif)

After capture, the images were processed to generate:

* A stitched orthomosaic map
* High-resolution overhead imagery
* A clean visual reference of the entire property

Processing time varies depending on dataset size, but this project required minimal post-production compared to video editing.

---

## The Deliverable: What This Project Produced

**Final Outputs:**

* High-resolution orthomosaic map
* Property-wide overhead view
* Export-ready imagery for reports or planning
* Archivable documentation for future comparison

**Estimated Market Value:** $249–$350  
(depending on site size and usage)

---

## Why This Case Study Matters

This project validates something important:

Drone mapping is not complicated — it’s **systematic**.

Compared to real estate video:

* Less creative decision-making
* Fewer revisions
* Clear scope
* Higher perceived value

This single mapping flight:

* Took under 45 minutes total
* Required no advanced equipment
* Produced a deliverable that can support $250+ pricing
* Scales easily with larger sites

---

## How This Connects to Construction & Development

This is the entry point.

The same workflow used here scales directly into:

* Construction progress documentation
* Pre-construction site capture
* Renovation before/after records
* Developer reporting
* Asset management

Instead of one-off videos, mapping enables:

* Monthly retainers
* Long-term projects
* Repeat clients
* Higher-ticket contracts
