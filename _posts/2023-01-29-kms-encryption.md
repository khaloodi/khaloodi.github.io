title: Using Amazon Key Management Service to Encrypt S3 and EBS Data
subtitle: "Getting familiar with AWS KMS and encryption"
---


In the associated lab we will step through using AWS KMS to encrypt S3 and EBS data. Our objective is to become more familiar with Amazon's Key Management Service and how it can be used to generate encryption keys used to encrypt/decrypt your data.

### Video Explanation:

Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data, and use those keys to encrypt data in S3 and EBS.

S3 is Amazon's Simple Storage Service, which is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. EBS is Amazon's Elastic Block Store, which is a block storage service that enables you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.

When you use KMS to encrypt your S3 and EBS data, you can be sure that your data is secure both at rest and in transit. KMS uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key to encrypt your data, which is a widely accepted and secure encryption standard.

To use KMS to encrypt your S3 and EBS data, you first need to create a key in KMS. Once you have created a key, you can use it to encrypt your S3 and EBS data by specifying the key when you create a new S3 bucket or EBS volume.

When you upload data to S3, you can specify that the data should be encrypted with the KMS key you created. When you create a new EBS volume, you can specify that the volume should be encrypted with the KMS key you created.

In addition to encryption, KMS also provides you with fine-grained access control over the keys you create. You can grant or revoke permissions to users and roles, and you can also audit the use of your keys.

In summary, using Amazon KMS for encrypting S3 and EBS data is a simple, secure and cost-effective way to protect your data at rest and in transit. It gives you the control to manage your encryption keys, and the flexibility to encrypt data in S3 and EBS in a way that suits your use case.
