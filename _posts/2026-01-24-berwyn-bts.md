## Context: What This Project Was

This was a real real estate drone video I shot for a residential property in Berwyn, Illinois.

The goal was simple: capture clean, cinematic aerial footage that would help the listing stand out online and give potential buyers a better sense of the property, the lot, and the surrounding neighborhood.

I handled the entire project end-to-end — from flight planning and shot design to filming, editing, and delivery.

This article breaks down exactly how the project was executed, what the client received, and why this type of work is one of the easiest entry points into building a profitable drone business.

## The Process: How the Shoot Actually Worked

### 1. Pre-Flight Planning

Before arriving on site, I mapped out a rough shot list and visual flow for the property.

The priority shots were:

* A wide establishing push-in to show the full property
* A mid-range orbit to highlight the home’s exterior
* A top-down reveal of the roof and lot
* A slow cinematic pass across the front facade

I also checked:

* Local airspace restrictions
* Wind conditions
* Lighting direction and sun angle

This planning phase took about 10–15 minutes but dramatically reduced mistakes and reshoots on location.

### 2. Gear Setup

![GIF PLACEHOLDER #2 — You holding controller / setting up drone](/img/me-with-controller.gif)

For this project I used:

* DJI drone for aerial capture
* Insta360 camera for behind-the-scenes footage
* iPhone screen recording to capture flight paths

Nothing exotic. No Hollywood-level rigging.

The entire setup fits in a single backpack.

This is important because it shows how accessible this type of business actually is.

---

### 3. Capturing the Shots

Once on site, I worked through the shot list in a logical order:

* Wide establishing shots first
* Mid-range orbits and push-ins
* Top-down and reveal shots last

This minimizes repositioning and battery swaps.

Each flight was 5–8 minutes long.

Total flight time on site: ~25 minutes.

I focused on:

* Slow, controlled movements
* Stable framing
* Clean lines and symmetry

No FPV tricks. No aggressive motion.

Just clean execution.

### 4. Editing Workflow

![GIF PLACEHOLDER #3 — Editing timeline / color grading](/img/editing-timeline.gif)

After the shoot, I imported the footage into my editing software and:

* Selected the best takes
* Stabilized and color-corrected clips
* Cut the sequence to music
* Exported a 4K master
* Created a vertical cut for social media

Total editing time: ~60–90 minutes.

---

## The Deliverable: What the Client Received

This is the part most people are curious about.

**Final Deliverables:**

* 60–90 second real estate drone video
* 4K resolution
* Licensed background music
* Color-graded footage
* Vertical social media version
* 48-hour turnaround

**Project Price:** $150

---

## Why This Type of Project Matters

This is not a one-off creative passion project.

This is a repeatable business asset.

Projects like this:

* Take under 3 hours total (planning + shooting + editing)
* Require minimal gear
* Are constantly needed by real estate agents
* Are easy to price and package

This single job works out to roughly $50/hour.

And that’s at a beginner-friendly price point.

With better positioning and packaging, this same service can easily be sold for $250–$400 per property.

## The Bigger Picture: From Real Estate to Mapping & Construction

This Berwyn project is the foundation layer.

Real estate drone work is one of the easiest ways to enter the market, build a portfolio, and generate early cash flow.

But it’s not the end game.

The exact same workflow you see here — planning, flying clean missions, delivering structured visual data — scales directly into:

* Drone mapping
* Construction site documentation
* Progress tracking
* Property measurements
* 3D models and orthomosaics

That’s where projects go from $150–$300 to $500–$2,000+ per job.

Over the next few weeks, I’ll be publishing:

* A full drone mapping project using Dronelink
* A construction site documentation case study
* Paid client work with full breakdowns

Each one will follow this same format.
