### 🎯 For Developers, Builders & Project Teams

If you need **more than photos and overhead maps**—and want a **true 3D understanding of your site**—this case study shows how drone capture can support **digital twin and BIM workflows**.

This project focuses on **3D reconstruction of a real construction site** and how that connects directly to modern **Virtual Design & Construction (VDC)** practices.

I currently offer through **Overwatch Drone Mapping (VDC Studio):**

* 3D drone modeling & digital twin creation  
* Orthomosaics & top-down site maps  
* Construction progress capture  
* BIM-aligned site documentation

## Context: What This Case Study Was

This project focused on **capturing and reconstructing a condominium construction site in 3D** using a structured drone orbit flight.

The subject property was the **Yorktown condo development**, and the goal was to create a **clean, navigable 3D model** that reflects current construction conditions.

Unlike the previous case study, which emphasized **2D mapping + site context**, this one explores:

➡️ How aerial capture feeds **3D spatial reconstruction**  
➡️ How that reconstruction supports **digital twin workflows**  
➡️ How drone data connects directly to **BIM environments like Revit**

This is **Case Study #3** in an ongoing real-world series building a drone-based VDC pipeline.

## The Objective

The mission focused on:

* Executing a clean orbit flight around the structure  
* Capturing full facade and roof coverage  
* Generating a photogrammetry-based 3D model  
* Evaluating the model for BIM / digital twin alignment  

The deliverable needed to answer:

* What does the building look like right now in 3D?
* How accurate is the geometry and massing?
* Can this be referenced in design or planning workflows?
* How useful is this for progress documentation?

## The Capture Process: Orbit-Based 3D Data Collection

### 1. Structured Orbit Flight

Instead of grid mapping, this mission used a **controlled orbital flight path** around the building.

Key capture priorities included:

* Consistent distance from the structure  
* Multiple vertical angles  
* Full facade coverage  
* Roof visibility  
* Clean overlap for photogrammetry processing  

The purpose here isn’t just imagery—it's **geometry reconstruction**.

The better the capture, the cleaner the model.

## The Output: Photogrammetry 3D Model

![GIF PLACEHOLDER #2 — 3D model rotating view](/img/cs3-3d-model.gif)

The captured imagery was processed into a **photogrammetry-based 3D mesh model** of the building.

This output provides:

* Accurate building massing  
* Real-world facade conditions  
* Spatial relationships to surroundings  
* A navigable 3D environment  

Unlike traditional photos or video, this allows stakeholders to:

* Inspect from any angle  
* Understand scale instantly  
* Review progress remotely  
* Reference real-world conditions without visiting the site

## From Drone Model → BIM & Digital Twin Workflow

![GIF PLACEHOLDER #3 — Model reference vs BIM/Revit environment](/img/cs3-bim-alignment.gif)

This is where the workflow becomes powerful.

I’m currently training and working inside **Revit**, which is a leading **BIM (Building Information Modeling)** platform used by architects, engineers, and contractors.

The connection:

**Drone Model (Reality Capture)**  
⬇  
**3D Mesh / Site Geometry**  
⬇  
**Reference for BIM Modeling in Revit**

This creates the foundation for a **digital twin workflow**:

A **digital twin** is a digital representation of a real-world asset that can be used for:

* Design coordination  
* Construction planning  
* Renovation analysis  
* Lifecycle asset management  

The drone model acts as **real-world truth**, while BIM models represent **designed intent**.

When combined, teams can:

* Compare design vs actual  
* Track progress over time  
* Identify discrepancies early  
* Improve coordination between field and design teams

## What This Project Produced

**Final Deliverables Included:**

* Photogrammetry 3D model (mesh + textured)  
* Exported model views (video + stills)  
* Web-shareable model preview  
* Progress documentation visuals  
* Written case study + workflow notes

## Why This Matters for Builders & Developers

This type of capture provides **something most sites don’t have**:

➡️ A **true 3D record of the project at a moment in time**

This is useful for:

* Construction progress documentation  
* Investor / stakeholder reporting  
* Pre-renovation analysis  
* Marketing & leasing visuals  
* Dispute resolution documentation  

And most importantly:

It creates the foundation for **BIM-integrated site workflows**.

## How This Fits Into a Scalable VDC Service

Through **Overwatch Drone Mapping**, this evolves beyond media into a **VDC-aligned service stack**:

* 2D orthomosaic site maps  
* 3D site & structure models  
* Progress tracking over time  
* BIM reference geometry  
* Digital twin datasets  

This creates:

* Higher-value retainers  
* Recurring monthly documentation  
* Integration with design teams  
* Clear deliverables with repeatable pricing
