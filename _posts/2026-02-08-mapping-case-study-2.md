### 🎯 For Developers, Builders & Property Owners

If you need **clear, decision-ready site visuals**—not just aerial footage—this case study documents how drone capture and on-the-ground context work together on a real job site.

This project shows how aerial data becomes useful when paired with physical site awareness.

I currently offer:

* Drone site mapping & documentation  
* Orthomosaics & overhead site visuals  
* Construction progress capture  
* Real estate & development support

## Context: What This Case Study Was

This project was a **real-world site mapping job**, focused on documenting an active property using both aerial capture and a physical site walkthrough.

Unlike Case Study #1—which centered on validating a repeatable mapping workflow—this project emphasized **context**.

The goal wasn’t just to generate an orthomosaic.  
It was to understand how aerial data and ground-level observation inform each other.

This is **Case Study #2** in an ongoing series documenting real drone mapping work as it’s learned, refined, and applied.

---

## The Objective

This mission focused on:

* Capturing structured aerial imagery  
* Walking the site to observe constraints and access points  
* Producing a clean orthomosaic for analysis  
* Evaluating how aerial perspective supports real decisions  

The deliverable needed to answer practical questions:

* How is the site laid out?
* Where are the access routes?
* What relationships aren’t obvious from the ground?
* What would matter to a developer or contractor reviewing this remotely?

## The Process: From Flight to Field Context

### 1. Aerial Capture

The flight was structured for **coverage and consistency**, not cinematic movement.

Key considerations included:

* Stable altitude across the site  
* Consistent overlap for mapping  
* Predictable flight paths  
* Clean image capture for stitching  

The goal was to produce imagery suitable for a high-quality orthomosaic—one that could actually be used, not just viewed.

### 2. Ground Walkthrough

Immediately after capture, I walked the site.

This step is critical and often overlooked.

From the ground, you notice:

* Access limitations
* Elevation changes
* Surface conditions
* Physical obstacles
* Context not obvious from above

These observations directly influence how the aerial data is interpreted.

Aerial imagery shows **what exists**.  
Ground context explains **why it matters**.

## The Output: Orthomosaic & Site Overview

![GIF PLACEHOLDER #3 — Orthomosaic preview / annotations](/img/cs2-orthomosaic-preview.gif)

The captured imagery was processed into a **high-resolution orthomosaic**, producing a scale-consistent, top-down view of the site.

This output provides:

* Accurate spatial relationships  
* Clear layout understanding  
* A shared reference for discussion and planning  

Unlike standard photos, an orthomosaic removes perspective distortion, allowing the site to be reviewed objectively.

This makes it useful for:

* Planning conversations  
* Remote review  
* Documentation  
* Baseline records  

---

## What This Project Produced

**Final Deliverables Included:**

* High-resolution orthomosaic (GeoTIFF)  
* Web-friendly orthomosaic image  
* Annotated map (PDF)  
* Detailed written case study  
* Field observations & insights

## Why This Case Study Matters

This project highlights an important truth:

Drone mapping is most valuable when it’s **context-aware**.

Aerial data alone can miss nuance.  
Ground observation alone can miss scale.

Together, they provide:

* Better situational awareness  
* Fewer assumptions  
* Clearer communication  
* More confident decisions  

This is what turns drone work from “cool visuals” into a professional service.

## How This Fits Into a Scalable Business

Projects like this are the foundation for:

* Construction progress documentation  
* Pre-development site evaluation  
* Renovation before/after records  
* Developer reporting  
* Long-term retainers  

Compared to traditional real estate video, mapping-focused work offers:

* Clear scope  
* Fewer revisions  
* Higher perceived value  
* Repeatable pricing

## Learn the Business Side

This case study is part of building **Overwatch Drone Mapping** in public.

If you’re interested in turning mapping and aerial services into real income, I documented the business framework separately:

It breaks down:
* Service packaging
* Pricing logic
* Client positioning
* Scaling beyond one-off jobs
