## About Me

Hi, I’m **Khaled Adad** — a data scientist, technician, and lifelong learner with a passion for blending technology and real-world problem-solving.  
My background spans data analytics, engineering diagnostics, and software systems — and I’m continuously exploring how emerging technologies can shape the way we build, measure, and interact with the world around us.

## Current Projects

### 🛰️ Overwatch — Precision-Based Aerial Services

**Overwatch** is my hands-on project at the intersection of **data science**, **drone technology**, and the **Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)** industry.  
What started as a curiosity about aerial data capture has evolved into a growing initiative to explore how **unmanned aerial systems (UAS)** can generate actionable insights through imaging, photogrammetry, and 3D modeling.

Built under my personal brand and hosted here on **khaledadad.com**, Overwatch serves two purposes:

1. To learn, document, and experiment with new technologies in aerial data collection and spatial analytics.  
2. To provide **precision-based aerial services** for residential and commercial clients — supporting inspections, construction planning, and digital documentation.

## Mission

To bridge the gap between **data and the built environment** by using drones as intelligent data-gathering tools.  
Overwatch focuses on transforming aerial visuals into measurable, meaningful information that supports decision-making in design, construction, and maintenance.

**Our mission is to:**

- Develop a modern workflow connecting **drone imagery**, **photogrammetry**, and **data analytics** for the AEC industry.  
- Deliver **accessible, accurate, and efficient** aerial services for real-world applications.  
- Continue learning and sharing the intersection of **AI, geospatial data, and drone technology** through open, documented experimentation.

## Looking Ahead

Overwatch is both a **project and a startup in development** — a long-term effort to merge my technical expertise with the needs of an evolving industry.  
As capabilities grow, I plan to integrate **3D modeling**, **digital twins**, and **data-driven visualization** into future service offerings.

At its core, Overwatch reflects my broader philosophy:  
> **To learn by building — and to create tools, systems, and insights that make the physical world more measurable, connected, and intelligent.**
